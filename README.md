This project contains tools for working with markdown files. Each tool has its own README.md file that describes it in more depth.

## [MDServer](https://github.com/petronius/markdown-utils/tree/master/mdserver)

A simple Python 2.x server that automagically converts static markdown files to HTML when serving them. Useful for small, static sites (although it probably can't handle a wild amount of traffic).

## [MDBuild](https://github.com/petronius/markdown-utils/tree/master/mdbuild)

A configurable tool for converting Markdown files into HTML, geared for generating static sites from a simple directory tree.
